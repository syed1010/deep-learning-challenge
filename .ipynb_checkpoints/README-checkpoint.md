Neural Network Model Report for Alphabet Soup Charity Funding Prediction

Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood of success for organizations funded by Alphabet Soup Charity. By utilizing historical funding data, this model will help Alphabet Soup make data-driven decisions about which applicants are most likely to use the funds effectively, thereby maximizing the impact of the charity’s contributions.

Data Preprocessing

Target Variable:

	•	The target variable for this model is IS_SUCCESSFUL, which indicates whether the organization’s use of funds was successful (1) or not (0).

Features:

	•	The features used in the model include APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.

Removed Variables:

	•	The EIN and NAME columns were removed from the dataset because they are identification columns that do not contribute to the predictive power of the model.

Handling Categorical Variables:

	•	Categorical variables with a high number of unique values, such as APPLICATION_TYPE and CLASSIFICATION, were analyzed. Rare categories were grouped under the label “Other” to reduce dimensionality and improve the model’s performance.

Encoding:

	•	Categorical variables were encoded using pd.get_dummies() to convert them into a numerical format suitable for the neural network model.

Data Splitting and Scaling:

	•	The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance.
	•	A StandardScaler was used to scale the features, ensuring that all data inputs are normalized, which helps improve the model’s learning efficiency.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

Model Structure:

	•	Neurons and Layers: The neural network model consisted of two hidden layers:
	•	First hidden layer: 80 neurons with the ReLU activation function.
	•	Second hidden layer: 30 neurons with the ReLU activation function.
	•	Output layer: 1 neuron with a sigmoid activation function to produce a binary output.

Model Compilation and Training:

	•	The model was compiled using the adam optimizer and binary_crossentropy loss function, suitable for binary classification problems.
	•	The model was trained over 100 epochs to ensure it learned the patterns in the data effectively.

Model Performance:

	•	After training, the model was evaluated using the test data, yielding the following results:
	•	Loss: 0.56
	•	Accuracy: 0.73

Results and Insights:

	•	The model successfully predicted the outcomes with 73% accuracy. While this accuracy rate is promising, further optimization is needed to achieve the target accuracy of over 75%.

Optimizing the Model

Optimization Techniques:

	•	To improve the model’s accuracy, various optimization techniques were considered, including:
	•	Adjusting the number of neurons in the hidden layers.
	•	Adding more hidden layers to increase the model’s complexity.
	•	Experimenting with different activation functions, such as tanh or sigmoid.
	•	Modifying the number of epochs to find the optimal training duration.

Impact of Optimization:

	•	Through optimization, the goal is to refine the model to achieve higher accuracy while preventing overfitting. Techniques like adding regularization layers (dropout) and tuning the learning rate of the optimizer can also be explored to enhance performance.

Alternative Models

Alternative Model Recommendation:

	•	A Random Forest Classifier could be considered as an alternative to the neural network model. Random Forests are robust to overfitting and can handle large datasets with higher-dimensional features effectively. They also provide feature importance, which can offer insights into which features are most impactful in predicting success.

Why Use a Random Forest Model?

	•	Random Forest models are easier to interpret compared to deep learning models and often require less tuning to achieve high accuracy. They can handle imbalanced datasets well and are less prone to overfitting, making them suitable for this type of classification problem.

Summary

The neural network model developed in this analysis provides a promising tool for Alphabet Soup Charity to predict the success of its funding initiatives. By achieving a 73% accuracy, the model shows potential but requires further optimization to meet the desired performance standards. Exploring alternative models like Random Forest could also provide valuable insights and improve the prediction accuracy, ensuring that the charity’s funds are utilized most effectively.

This structured approach provides a clear and concise report on the development and performance of the neural network model, addressing all necessary components and analysis to support Alphabet Soup’s decision-making process.
